<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    The complication in the 6th mission of the series is that now there might be needed more than one light bulb to illuminate a room. And this is the 5th argument of the function - how many light bulbs are needed to illuminate the room.
</p>

<p>
    For example, if you need 3 bulbs to illuminate a room, then we don’t count the time when there were only 2 bulbs or only one. If the last argument of the function is not passed, then one light bulb is enough to illuminate the room.
</p>

<p>
The task is still the same - to find out how long the room was lit (in this task, we can say - sufficiently lit).
